// Goal: Kellogg course reviews API!
//
// Business logic:
// - Courses can be taught by more than one lecturer (e.g. Brian Eng's KIEI-451 and Ben Block's KIEI-451)
// - Information on a course includes the course number (KIEI-451) and name (Intro to Software Development)
// - Lecturers can teach more than one course (e.g. Brian Eng teaches KIEI-451 and KIEI-925)
// - Reviews can be written (anonymously) about the lecturer/course combination (what would that be called?)
// - Reviews contain a String body, and a numeric rating from 1-5
// - Keep it simple and ignore things like multiple course offerings and quarters; assume reviews are written
//   about the lecturer/course combination only â€“ also ignore the concept of a "user" and assume reviews
//   are written anonymously
//
// Tasks:
// - (Lab) Think about and write the domain model - fill in the blanks below
// - (Lab) Build the domain model and some sample data using Firebase
// - (Lab) Write an API endpoint, using this lambda function, that accepts a course number and returns 
//   information on the course and who teaches it
// - (Homework) Provide reviews of the lecturer/course combinations 
// - (Homework) As part of the returned API, provide the total number of reviews and the average rating for 
//   BOTH the lecturer/course combination and the course as a whole.

// === Domain model - fill in the blanks ===
// There are 4 models: courses, lecturers, sections, reviews
// There is one many-to-many relationship: courses <-> lecturers, which translates to two one-to-many relationships:
// - One-to-many: courses -> sections
// - One-to-many: lecturers -> sections
// And one more one-to-many: sections -> reviews
// Therefore:
// - The first model, courses, contains the following fields: courseNumber, name
// - The second model, lecturers, contains the following fields: name
// - The third model, sections, contains the following fields: courseId, lecturerId
// - The fourth model, reviews, contains the following fields, sectionId, body, rating

// allows us to use firebase
let firebase = require(`./firebase`)

// /.netlify/functions/courses?courseNumber=KIEI-451
